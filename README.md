Try regression to forecast the price for some stock market blue chips on historical data from yahoo.finance.com
1. Apple Inc. (AAPL)
2. Gold Dec 20 (GC=F)
3. Crude Oil Dec 20 (CL=F)

Despite the Y2020 was slightly unusual for the prediction purposes, the trends and sycles have been catched more or less fine for Apple stocks and Gold prices.
Crude oil price prediction has probably been failed, and one may presume that this domain market moves are visibly less natural then Apple and Gold market moves or crude oil data set covers too short time periode to catch the trends and cicles.

It is clear, that COVID19 related drop  in March 2020 has not been predicted, well this issue obfiously has not any market-based couses and could be forecasted on additional data based on human population, weather and so on.

Prediction on shortest periodes (quarter, month, week) looks better, but was less interesting for analysis.
